	<h2>What is this?</h2>
	<p>
		GridDude is simply a website with a dude on a grid. The dude is a colored square.
		Over in the real world I have this button panel hooked up to an Arduino, which in turn is hooked up to an esp8266.
		This WiFi-module allows me to communicate my button presses to the server you got this site from.
		The four buttons each correspond to a direction on the grid, and using it I can get the dude to move.
		Every tile remembers how many times it has been stepped on, and the higher the number, the darker the tile.
		<br>
		The purpose? Having something I can push repeatedly in patterns.
